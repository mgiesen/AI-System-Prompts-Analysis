# AI-System-Prompts-Analysis

This repository contains my research and analysis of system prompts used by various AI models. The goal is to understand how different models are instructed at a system level and what capabilities or limitations these instructions impose.

## Purpose

Understanding system prompts helps in:
- Comparing model capabilities and limitations
- Identifying potential biases in model outputs
- Optimizing interactions with these models
- Exploring how different companies approach AI safety and alignment

### Disclaimer

The system prompts documented in this repository were reconstructed solely through interaction with publicly accessible language models. They do not represent official or verified internal documents from any provider. This repository is intended for research and analysis purposes only.

The prompts may be incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate. No technical protection mechanisms were bypassed during collection. All content is based on legal and standard user interactions.
